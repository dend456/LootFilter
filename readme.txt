Extract files anywhere, run LootFilter.exe after starting the game. It may take a minute to complete.

By default it will use the endgame_items.txt filter file which filters ~99% of the items in the game so
check the file to make sure something you want isn't hidden.

You can create new filter files and drag them onto the .exe to run them. 
The string replacing an item's name cannot be longer than the original item name.
